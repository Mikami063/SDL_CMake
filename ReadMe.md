# Welcome to Cmake Version of SDL_GameEngine

## find a good website explain the ECS(entity_component_system) in detail

https://austinmorlan.com/posts/entity_component_system/#What%20Is%20An%20Ecs?

## general

I'm just tired of poor c++ support on Xcode.

Install SDL2 and SDL2_image to /Library/Frameworks to build

use VSCode plugin CMake Tools

type in command panel >CMake: Configure

and >CMake: Debug

build for MacOS, not sure of other system, good luck get it to work

This repo is for me to follow along the tutorial of a C++ GameEngine series, to ultimately understand basic structure of a GameEngine, not a framework for other people to work on, thus no support

This readme is a reminder note for myself, I know I will definitely forget how to build my project, 100%

Cheers
